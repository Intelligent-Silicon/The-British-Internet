# The British Internet

Over the years I have witnessed a lot of changes.

In the past I have been able to lock down my systems to account for every packet of data going in and out of the network, but todays thats no longer the case.

So what prompted this repo? I'm getting sick to death of webpages simply not loading. I do a search in google, click the link and the webpage fails to load. 

This isnt down to my broadband provider because it happens in JD Wetherspoons, the Library and elsewhere which provides free wifi.

Other things I have noticed is if successful in blocking out trackers from webpages, you'll find the prices of some websites go up. 

In other words, if you dont mind being tracked some websites will show you better prices. 

Is privacy now worthless, or worst still now a cost we cant afford?

Its funny in a sarcastic way because gaining access to sites that steal your life like Reddit with doom scrolling have no problems at showing themselves, but try and gain access to a website like MS to look up an API and it will just hang there for ever!

WTF gives?
